Code Smells

1) OBSOLETE COMMENTS
A comment that has gotten old, irrelevant and incorrect is obsolete. Comments get old quickly. It is best not to write a comment that will become obsolete. If you find an obsolete comment, it is best to update or get rid of it. 

2) REDUNDANT COMMENT
   A comment is redundant if it describes something that adequately describes itself. For example:
   i++ // increment i
   
3) COMMENTED-OUT CODE


FUNCTIONS

F1) Too Many Arguments

functions should have a small number of arguments. No argument is best followed by one,two and three. More than three is very questionable and should be avoided.

F2) Dead Function

Methods that are never called should be discarded. Keeping dead code around is wasteful.

F3) Duplication of code
Keep your function DRY(Don't repeat yourself)


GENERAL

G1 Use explanatory Variables

G2 Functions Names should say what they do

G3 Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants

G4 Encapsulate Conditionals
  boolean logic is hard enough to understand without having to see it in the context of an if or statement. Extract functions that explain the intent of the conditional.
  
G5 Functions should do only one thing.
